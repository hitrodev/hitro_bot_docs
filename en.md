## What is HitroBot

HitroBot — fully automated algorithmic robot that trades cryptocurrency futures.

It is integrated with the Binance exchange as a trading platform. Binance users can connect to the robot.

Is it worth using HitroBot?
**The robot has positive profitability, it is public and available on the [Binance Leaderboard](https://www.binance.com/en/futures-activity/leaderboard?type=myProfile&encryptedUid=CEFC421368F9D59B8499CE65813D7FCA).**

Average profitability is above **+30-50%**. Testing of the algorithm on historical data (backtesting) shows positive results at the end of each month.
Backtesting results are available [here](/backtesting/report.md).

It is worth noting that the robot can sometimes close trades at a loss, therefore, on the PNL (Profit and Loss) chart, you can sometimes see short-term drawdowns, for example: October 6 -5.5%, October 17 -15%.
This is fine, as the overall portfolio size is going up!

More information about the robot can be found in the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions-1) section.

## How to start using HitroBot

In order for HitroBot to start trading for you, you will need:
- an account in the [Telegram messenger](https://telegram.org)
- an account on the [Binance exchange](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=N587Q7WB) (registration instructions are [below](#binance-registration-and-account-setup-1))
- $1,000.00 in your account

So, the instructions for connecting to HitroBot:
1. Go to [@hitro_crypto_bot](https://t.me/hitro_crypto_bot) Telegram-bot and press `Start`. You will control the robot through it.
2. The bot will ask you to send an invitation. You can send it your invitation or the default one `82J2B6KZ`.
3. Log in or register with Binance ([instructions](#binance-registration-and-account-setup-1)).
4. The bot will ask you to send API Keys for trading for your Binance account. Set up the API Keys ([instructions](#api-keys-setup)) and send API Key first, then API Secret to the bot.
5. Fund your Futures account on Binance ([instructions](#how-to-deposit-and-withdraw-funds-1)).
6. In the bot menu press `Activate the robot`. It will validate given API keys. If the bot returned an error, check if the keys were set up correctly.
7. **Done! Now the robot trades and earns money for you!**
8. You can control the robot and view statistics through the Telegram-bot menu ([more details](#using-telegram-bot-1)).

> Note:
> - You should not close positions opened by the robot, this may interfere with the algorithm.
> - Positions in the futures account opened not by the robot will be closed to ensure the integrity of trading.


## Binance registration and account setup

To register with Binance:
1. Go through the [referral link](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=N587Q7WB) that gives a *-10%* commission discount.
2. Then the usual: register with your email, phone number, password.
3. To remove the account limits, as well as to be able to create API keys that the robot will need, [complete the Identity Verification](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360027287111). You will need to send a scan of your ID document.
4. Then [open the Futures USDⓈ-M account](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360033772992), which the bot will use to trade.

The registration and account setup are complete! Now you can move on to configuring API access.

### API Keys setup

5. Create an API key with any name following the [instructions](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072).
6. Press "Edit restrictions" and set "Enable Futures" — the access to trade in Futures account. It should look like this:
![API restrictions](/images/api-restrictions.png)

Done! Now you can send API Key and API Secret to the Telegram-bot.  
The robot will not have permission to withdraw funds, you don't have to worry about that.


## Using Telegram-bot

The trading robot is controlled via the Telegram-bot [@hitro_crypto_bot](https://t.me/hitro_crypto_bot).
After [account activation in the bot](#как-подключиться-к-hitrobot-1) you'll be able to:
- View status and statistics of trades in various time intervals.
- Suspend/resume the robot.
- Update API keys if necessary.

Menu appears when you send any message in the chat, just in case.


## How to deposit and withdraw funds

There are two types of accounts that you should know about:
- "Fiat and Spot" — main account that can be funded with cash/crypto, you can buy and hold crypto there and withdraw funds from it.
- "Futures" — an account, the main purpose of which is speculative trading. This account is used by the robot to trade.

You can easily transfer funds between these accounts. HitroBot uses only *Futures USDⓈ-M* account and doesn't touch other accounts at all.

### Deposit

There are millions of ways to top up the main account. But each of them is charged a fee.

For me I chose [card depositing with Euro](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/a6f4eb39c27347109b5091dfee3ec96a) as the simplest, fastest and cheapest method.

1. So, fund your account using one of the available methods, for example:
   - [card deposit](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/a6f4eb39c27347109b5091dfee3ec96a)
   - [P2P deposit](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360043832851)
2. Convert fiat currency into USDT: *Trade -> Convert (or Classic)*.
3. Transfer USDT from the Spot account to the Futures USDⓈ-M account for the robot to start trading.

### Withdraw

For withdrawal you need to perform basically the same order of actions as with depositing but in reverse.

1. Firstly, transfer funds from Futures account to Spot wallet.
2. Convert USDT to fiat currency: *Trade -> Convert (or Classic)*.
3. Then: *Withdraw -> Withdraw Fiat*. Or you can [try P2P](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360041106311) for withdrawals.


## HitroBot commission

Users of HitroBot pay a commission of **30% of the profit**.

For example, the robot gained from $1000 to $1100. The profit would be `$1100 - $1000 = $100`.  
Then the commission would be `$100 * 30% / 100 = $30`.

The commission is taken only from the profit since the moment of either topping up the account or the last commission.
That means if the robot closes a period of time at a loss, it continues to trade without fees until the size of the portfolio reaches the last maximum.

An example: since the last commission the account balance is $1100. The robot lost $50 in a week. No commission is charged, the robot continues to trade.  
Next week the robot gains $100. The account has `$1100 - $50 + $100 = $1150`.  
The profit is `$1150 - $1100 = $50`, and the commission is `$50 * 30% / 100 = $15`.

The commission schedule is as follows:
- **first 3 charges** are every **3 days** since the moment the robot was started
- **next 2 charges** are every **week**
- next charges are **2 weeks**

The Telegram-bot will send you the information about commission size and the wallets where to send USDT.
The transaction should be made from your Binance account that is connected to HitroBot. In this case it will understand that this account is yours.

When the robot receives the money the Telegram-bot will notify you about that.

> Advice: When sending funds for the first time, send a few dollars first, wait for confirmation from the bot, which is usually sent in a few minutes.
> Then you can send the rest.  
> Thus, in case of an error in the wallet address or other parameters only a small fraction of the funds will be lost.

If the commission is not paid, the robot will be suspended.


## Binance restrictions

HitroBot can manage only a limited number of accounts due to some Binance restrictions on the number of API calls and orders per minute.
Currently the maximum number of users is **200**.

When the number of active users exceeds the maximum, users with larger balance of the Futures USDⓈ-M account have the priority.
In other words, all accounts are sorted in descending order of the account balance, and the robot manages the first 200.

The Telegram-bot will notify you about possible displacement from the top-200.
If the user is not in the top, the robot will be suspended for his account.


## Frequently asked questions

**Question:** Can the robot withdraw my funds?  
**Answer:** No, because it doesn't have API permissions to do that. When you set up API access, you only give permission to trade futures.

**Q:** How does the robot work?  
**A:** It trades futures using a smart strategy that was developed and tested for over six months. It buys low and sells high, simple :)

**Q:** Does the robot use leverage?  
**A:** Yes, for one trade the robot can use a margin of 1X to 3X. It is safe because the program strictly controls the stop-loss and does not let the price fall below the formula value.
